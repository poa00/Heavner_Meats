Based on the documentation provided for the `ahkv2` class context, let's walk through a detailed example guide to extending and inheriting classes and objects. This guide will cover how to create base classes, extend these classes, and utilize inherited properties and methods effectively.

### Creating a Base Class

First, let's create a simple base class named `Animal`. This class will serve as a template for specific types of animals.

```ahk
class Animal {
    Species := "Undefined"
    Sound := "Silence"
    
    __New(species, sound) {
        this.Species := species
        this.Sound := sound
    }

    MakeSound() {
        MsgBox, % "A " this.Species " makes this sound: " this.Sound "."
    }
}
```

In this class:
- `Species` and `Sound` are instance variables.
- The `__New` method initializes the instance variables with the given arguments.
- The `MakeSound` method displays a message with the animal's sound.

### Extending the Base Class

Let's extend the `Animal` class to create a more specific `Dog` class.

```ahk
class Dog extends Animal {
    __New() {
        ; Call the base class constructor with specific values for a dog.
        super.__New("Dog", "Bark")
    }
}
```

In the `Dog` class:
- It inherits properties (`Species` and `Sound`) and methods (`MakeSound`) from `Animal`.
- The `__New` method uses `super.__New` to call the `__New` method of the base class, specifying `Dog` and `Bark` as the species and sound.

### Utilizing Inherited Properties and Methods

Now, let's create an instance of the `Dog` class and call its method to see inheritance in action.

```ahk
Fido := new Dog()
Fido.MakeSound()  ; Expected output: "A Dog makes this sound: Bark."
```

This demonstrates that `Fido`, an instance of `Dog`, has access to both the inherited properties and methods from `Animal`.

### Overriding Methods

We can also override a method in a derived class to provide specialized behavior.

```ahk
class Cat extends Animal {
    __New() {
        super.__New("Cat", "Meow")
    }

    MakeSound() {
        ; Call the base class method.
        super.MakeSound()
        MsgBox, % "Cats also purr."
```ahk
    }
}
```

In the `Cat` class:
- We override the `MakeSound` method to first call the base implementation (`super.MakeSound()`) and then add additional behavior specific to cats.

### Testing the Cat Class

```ahk
Whiskers := new Cat()
Whiskers.MakeSound()  
; Expected output: 
; "A Cat makes this sound: Meow."
; "Cats also purr."
```

### Summary

By following this guide, you've learned how to:
- Create a base class with ahkv2 and define instance variables and methods.
- Extend a base class to create derived classes that inherit properties and behavior.
- Utilize the `super` keyword to access base class methods within derived class methods.
- Override methods in derived classes to provide specialized behavior while still being able to call the base class version.

This example showcases the power of object-oriented programming in `ahkv2`, allowing for clean, reusable, and extendable code structures.
