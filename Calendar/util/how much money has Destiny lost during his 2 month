how much money has Destiny lost during his 2 months of travel? [math challenge]

My math will **strictly** be around his suspected Kick contract revenue. Ill leave other revenue to people more familiar with channel and donation cash. 

TLDR math at the bottom. 

## preamble

We all know, streamer man has been away a lot. As a 5 year talk radio convert, its been disruptive but tolerable. 

I thought about all that money he got signed for (without an exact figure) and how it was structured, and the negative downstream incentives it may have created. 

Hourly contracts for streamers has to be a weird incentive. I don't know what the contingencies are, or how you could enforce someone being entertaining. For conversation let's say this, As long as he's on stream physically he's earning his pay, it positions the content below just existing on stream. At the same time, allowing the streamer to post to youtube and restream, it keeps the incentive of donations, and youtube videos. 

I don't know any of this would actually be strong enough to impact a streamers content, just some thoughts. It may remove the feeling that streamers have to keep going RIGHT NOW. What's a month off if you get paid the same at 1000 viewers vs 10,000 viewers. Plus that gives tiny the ability to build huge connections and support his political efforts. 

## what we know

I wont be grabbing time stamps for these quotes but feel free to correct me in the comments. Ill gladly take feedback. 

- a couple months ago, Destiny mention to dan when pressed about the contract value he stated (paraphrasing) "less than 10 more than 4" in regards to the value of the contract in millions. 

- in a convo with MOOT around the same time, moot mentioned "congrats on becoming a millionaire" and destiny replied "well not yet but thanks"

I am inferring greatly here, but I think we can assume this referrs to the hourly structure most kick contracts are made in.
